    <h2>GHMC</h2>
    <p>GHMC was not satisfied with the manual attendance system for the sanitary field staff (SFA’s) and the entomology staff...</p>`,
    content: `<h3>About GHMC</h3>
    <p>The <span class="strong">Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC)</span> is the civic body that overlooks the city of Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana state. It is the local body for the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. GHMC was formed on 16th april 2007, merging 12 municipalities and 8 gram-panchayats.</p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>GHMC was not satisfied with the manual attendance system for the <span class="strong">sanitary field staff (SFA’s)</span> and the <span class="strong">entomology staff</span> in 5 zones under its jurisdiction. There were many <span class="strong">false</span> entries and <span class="strong">manipulations</span> happening which led to a huge financial loss for GHMC every month. So they wanted a modern and malpractice free <span class="strong">biometric system</span> for 22000 plus staffs assigned in each of these 5 zones.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>GHMC wanted a <span class="strong">Aadhaar based biometric attendance system (AEBAS)</span>, which is linked to the aadhaar card details, so that manipulations can be avoided. <span class="strong">Analogics</span> provided them with <span class="strong">LOTUS</span> which is a handheld computer developed using <span class="strong">Java</span> or <span class="strong">C</span> language.</p>
    <p>It can be equipped with GPRS, 3G, WLAN or GSM, so that there is a database which is constantly updated with reports. LOTUS can be customized according the needs in this particular case a biometric sensor is used to scan the fingerprints.</p>
    <p><span class="strong">LOTUS</span> is an encrypted attendance management system and provides an end-to-end solution that was much needed for the municipal body to govern staff attendance. This system also has geofencing which enables it to work only in zone numbering 6. With a error free database for attendance, payroll management system can be linked to it so that salaries are provided effortlessly.</p>
    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>With the new system in place, there is a steady increase in percentage of attendance which is approximately 70% compared to 30% with the conventional method. Which directly reflects in the average savings of ₹ 4.5 cr per month by GHMC. After witnessing the drastic change in figures, there are around 12000 units??? of <span class="strong">LOTUS</span> deployed in and around Hyderabad. Which eliminates the root cause of introducing this system: “<span class='strong'>bogus employees</span>”.</p>

    <h2>Board of Intermediate, TS</h2>
    <p>The board regulates and supervises the system of intermediate education in Telangana State. It executes and governs...</p>`,
    content: `<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The past few years have witnessed many businesses rushing to the cloud. The move has not been easy though. Organizations faced and continue to face numerous hurdles because of the complexity of modern IT applications, coupled with the scarcity of skills in cloud technologies. Having successfully adopted the cloud after enduring all the hardships, it is natural to wonder if the move to the cloud has been worthwhile for the organizations. Is this all just for cost savings of doing away with expensive datacenters?</p>
    <div class="highlight">"Do organizations like Netflix at the forefront of cloud usage innovation see any benefits beyond what meets the eye?"</div>
    <p>On the surface, it may seem that Cloud just helps organizations offload critical datacenter operations that are non-differentiating and are non-core activities. Cloud does tremendously help with this aspect since managing a datacenter is no easy task warranting skilled IT workforce and therefore, diluting the primary focus of the organization. However, the cloud offers many other benefits that are <span class="strong">not immediately obvious.</span></p>
    <!-- <img src="http://cloudaccel.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cloud-Challenges-9-e1535359262947-1024x410.jpg" /> -->
    <h3>Six compelling reasons for companies to adopt cloud services:</h3>
    <h4>1. Change Agility:</h4>
    <p>Organizations at the forefront of cloud usage are able to roll out hundreds of enhancements per day. Only a handful of organizations had such an ability a decade ago. This agility, in turn, is driving business innovation into high gear. Businesses are able to experiment a lot faster, identify the combinations that work and quickly move to subsequent opportunities.</p>
    <h4>2. Reliability:</h4>
    <p>With the scale of operation, all large cloud providers are able to offer features that significantly improve reliability:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud providers have better redundancy at each data center level from power supply to internet providers to internal networks and network devices etc.</li>
      <li>Organizations have fallback options of multiple independent datacenters within a region, and multiple regions within all major continents, with the ability to move applications from one region to another seamlessly.</li>
      <li>Organizations have access to sophisticated tools and technologies required to failover within a region, country or continent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Scalability:</h4>
    <p>Predicting data center capacity a few years ahead has always been a challenge. However, organizations across the spectrum face data-explosion this has become even more daunting. At the same time, the value of scalability has been increasing. Data is the new oil. As new tools and algorithms are becoming available to extract intelligence to improve sales, improve product quality, reduce costs etc. a fixed sized data center can become a drag. Cloud alleviates the need for upfront capacity estimation. Cloud not provides the scale when required but also the necessary tools to achieve the same at significantly lower costs.</p>
    <h4>4. Security:</h4>
    <p>Cloud providers have been rolling out numerous innovations on the security front. From security compliant storage encryption to simplified modeling and rollout of network firewall rules, granular audit trails, tools to monitor network flows and real-time analytics and alerts enable InfoSec department to run a more secure environment. Achieving the same in an on-prem data center requires highly skilled System admins, Network admins, Security experts.</p>
    <h4>5. Reduced Costs:</h4>
    <p>Cloud enables organizations to run leaner IT. Organizations have been able to achieve 90% reduction in off-peak cloud spend as compared to peak traffic cloud spend. For online systems operating 24x7 with peak traffic for 12 hours on weekdays, has over 65% offpeak hours. For offline and batch processing systems, the off-peak hours could be even higher.</p>
    <h4>6. Business Focus:</h4>
    <p>Reliable and Secure IT infrastructure is as essential as electricity and phones to operate businesses. Similar to electricity, setting up and operating IT infrastructure is non-core and non-differentiating activity. An on-prem datacenter ties down organizations scarce and skilled talent in operations, in addition to taking precious time from management for oversight. Properly setup cloud frees up skilled employees to focus on activities of higher value-add, helps organization overall spend less time on operations and more time on development.</p>
    <div class="highlight">Cloud Services offer greater efficiency, improved collaboration, increased security and above all - cost-effectiveness.</div>
    <div class="highlight">According to Capgemini and Sogeti: Companies using the cloud to automate their legacy applications and IT operations processes systems are gaining a significant advantage over those behind the curve.</div>
